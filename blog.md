Both Moretti and Drucker argue that visual forms (e.g. graphs, maps, etc.) can and should be used to represent cultural phenomena (e.g. the experience of temporality, rises and falls in genre, etc.). Moving between written and visual mediums of expression offers a model for the next generation of digital humanities scholarship, where readers are asked to think critically across both textual and graphical modes. As such, digital humanities scholarship should increasingly create multimodal scholarship where readers interpret both the text and any other media (such as graphs, images, audio, and so on). Creating scholarship that asks readers to interpret across multiple modes will distinguish digital humanities scholarship from scholarship in the sciences.

Drucker and Moretti, in their writings are trying to prove that visual expression is necessary when it comes to digital humanities. They argue that it provides a different perspective to look at data from and that can be valuable. I totally agree with Drucker and Morettiâ€™s writing because I do feel that visual expression is a vital part of the digital humanities. It is the digital humanities and I feel that having visual aids such as graphs and images, adds a new perspective to the topic at hand. That is important because not only does it help to look at data from a different view, but that leads to making it easier to understand the data. I feel that when data is visualized, it leads to readers better understanding the data. That is the beauty of the digital humanities and those are some of the main concepts that Drucker and Moretti have tried to express.

In order to effectively analyze the point that Drucker and Moretti were trying to make, I took their respective writings and put them in a data visualization tool called Voyant. The picture below is a screenshot of one of the visualizations from Voyant, on Drucker.
